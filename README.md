# Using React to build a Single-Page Application to publish your news story

This Single-page Applicaiton was built with React JavaScript library my Masters in Interactive Journalism. My goal was to learn the fundamentals of REACT, improve my JavaScript and learn more about deploying Single Page Applications for the purpose of journalistic work.

## Getting Started

To run locally download this repository to your machine. 

### Prerequisites

1. Install Homebrew
Although you can install Node in other ways, I recommend using Homebrew. Homebrew lets you avoid possible security problems associated with using the sudo command to install software like Node and Node modules.

Type:
```sh
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

You’ll see messages in the Terminal explaining what you need to do to complete the installation process. You can learn more about Homebrew at the Homebrew website.
      
2. Install node

Open the Terminal app and type brew update. This updates Homebrew with a list of the latest version of Node.

Type:

```sh
brew install node
```

Kick back and relax. Homebrew has to download some files and install them. But that’s it.

##### Test it!
Make sure you have Node and NPM installed by running simple commands to see what version of each is installed:

Test Node. To see if Node is installed, type:

```sh
node -v
```
in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this v0.10.31.

Test NPM. To see if NPM is installed, type:

```sh
npm -v 
```
in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this 1.4.27

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local environment. 

2. Ensure the downloaded project folder is your current directory in Terminal. 

3. To install the ype:

```sh
npm install 
```
4. type:

```sh
npm start 
```

If successful, terminal you will see:

```sh
Compiled successfully!

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
